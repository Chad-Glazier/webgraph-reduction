Run the following from the CLI to produce the reduced webgraphs.

```
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="App"
```

If you run out of heap memory or if you need to restrict it, try adjusting it within the `.mvn/jvm.config` file.

```
 -Xmx4g -Xms512m
```

The above setting limits the heap size to a minimum of 512 MB and a maximum of 4 GB.

# Reduced Graphs

All of the reduced graphs generated by this app will be in CSV format.

# Data Source

All data files should be found in the top-level `data` directory. They are omitted from this repository, so for the sake of reproducibility the steps taken to obtain/format them are listed here.

1. The following files were downloaded from [CommonCrawl's 2017 web crawl](https://data.commoncrawl.org/projects/hyperlinkgraph/cc-main-2017-feb-mar-apr-hostgraph/index.html).
    - `vertices.txt.gz`: This compressed file was uncompressed and renamed `2017-node-domains.txt`.
    - `bvgraph.graph`, `bvgraph.properties`, and `bvgraph.offsets`: These files represent a single webgraph; the basename was changed from `bvgraph` to `2017` (file extensions were unchanged).
    - `bvgraph-t.graph`, `bvgraph-t.properties`, and `bvgraph-t.offsets`: These files represent the transpose of the original webgraph; the basename for these files was changed from `bvgraph-t` to `2017-t`.
2. The following files were downloaded from [CommonCrawl's 2024 web crawl](https://data.commoncrawl.org/projects/hyperlinkgraph/cc-main-2024-jul-aug-sep/index.html).
    - `cc-main-2024-jul-aug-sep-host-vertices.paths.gz`: This file contains a list of paths to download 15 separate compressed text files. Each of these 15 files were downloaded, uncompressed, and then concatenated into a single text file named `2024-node-domains.txt`. Since the files are fairly large, it's not practical to copy+paste the files together. If you are on Linux, I would recommend repeatedly running `cat file1.txt >> 2024-node-domains.txt` for each of the 15 files. The result should be a text file just under 10 GB.
    - `cc-main-2024-jul-aug-sep-host.graph`, `cc-main-2024-jul-aug-sep-host.properties`: These two files represent the main webgraph; these files were renamed to `2024.graph` and `2024.properties`, respectively.
    - `cc-main-2024-jul-aug-sep-host-t.graph`, `cc-main-2024-jul-aug-sep-host-t.properties`: These files represent the transpose of the webgraph; these files were renamed to `2024-t.graph` and `2024-t.properties`, respectively.

All totaled, the `data` directory has 12 distinct files with a combined 40 GB.
