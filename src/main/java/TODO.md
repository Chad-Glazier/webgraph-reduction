- make the NodeDomainMap thing
    - should iterate over a sequence of node ID's, then return a HashTable that maps each ID (int) to a domain name (String).
- make the Subgraph class
    - should iterate over a sequence of node ID's, then construct a subgraph from the original graph.
    - should include a method to write the output as a pair of CSV files:
        - nodes.csv, which has columns "node_id,domain_name", and
        - edges.csv, which has columns "from_id,to_id".
- finish the TopIndegrees class.
    - should be able to produce an iterable collection of node ID's with the top n indegrees.
- make a PageRank class.
    - should work on a Subgraph, and return the top n ranked nodes with their score.
